Twitter Module for Titanium Mobile
-----------------------------------
So this is my approach to the twitter OAuth API for the Titanium Mobile contest.

Using this module is pretty straightforward.
I didn't had the time to include more tests and examples.
There's also still an issue with android that I couldn't fix.

All tests are running, so the correct signatures and signing keys get generated.
The problem seems to be on the HTTP Request, that get's sent to twitter. It seems like the Authorization header doesn't get set.

But anyways - I just did this for fun.
